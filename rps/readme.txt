Battle Rps by James E. Ward

Use at your own risk. Any damage caused by this is not the responsibility of the developer.

To use your own output create a file named rps.txt and put it in the same folder as the program.
Each output should have 3 choices in order starting with the name then a 5 row ASCII art.

Hopefully Joe will be able to explain this better than me.
