README file for "TetRLs" by John L. Greco

INTRO:
======
TetRLs (announced on rec.games.roguelike.development as TetrisRL, "official"
name changed for copyright/trademark reasons) is my 2009 7drl Challenge entry.
It is a highly experimental roguelike with gameplay stylized after the hit
computer game Tetris, created by Alexey Pajitnov in 1985 while working at 
the Academy of Science of the USSR.

You probably know it, it's only the most famous computer game of all time.


BUILDING AND INSTALLATION:
==========================
TetRLs' only dependency is NCurses (for *nix platforms) or PDCurses (for windows)
Provided is a basic makefile that *should* work on any Linux/BSD system.
simply run:

	make
	./tetrisrl

to build and run TetRLs.

For building windows binaries I'm afraid you are on your own, the makefile
'Makefile.mingw' is included and works for me using the MinGW tools provided
with Fedora 10.  I did however have to build my own copy of PDCurses so that
I could statically link with it.  You can find more information about that at
http://www.mail-archive.com/pdcurses-l@lightlink.com/msg00053.html

A pre-built windows binary is included for your convenience, though I have not
personally tested it.


PREMISE:
========
In TetRLs you play an unidentified character who is apparently trapped
in the laboratory of a mad soviet scientist, forced to participate in some
sort of bizarre mind-game experiment that involves a lot of arranging of oddly
shaped crates.  However, you must balance this task with battling dozens of
highly aggressive lab rats that apparently escaped (or were released...).


GAMEPLAY:
=========
TetRLs' gameplay is relatively simple for a roguelike, movement keys supported
(on Standard US QWERTY keyboards) are: "vi-keys", "wasd", "arrow keys" and
"numpad".  You may choose to use whichever scheme you wish at any time though
use of the arrow keys is discouraged because that scheme does not provide easy
access to diagonal movement keys.

To clear each level the player must place a certain number of tetrominos on the
board while trying not to get killed by some lab-rats that appear over time.
The player may attack and kill the lab rats with a wrench by "bumping" into them,
otherwise the level may eventually become to cluttered by rats to be playable.

Should the player get too close to a rat for too long, the rat may bite and injure
the player, reducing their HP level.  The only way to increase HP after being
attacked is to place more tetrominos.  Particularly, the player receives a bonus
amount of hit points if they complete an entire line with the tetrominos.

Once the player has placed the proper number of tetrominos, the door on the
right of the room will open up and upon reaching it the player will enter
the next level (and be unable to return).  As levels progress the required
tetrominos need to advance increases, as does the rate of lab rat generation.

The game is complete when the player completes 5 levels (75 tetrominos total).
