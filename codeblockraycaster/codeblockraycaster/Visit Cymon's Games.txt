The code may not be pretty, but for a program so small this program does something amazing. Originally written to fit use no more than 80x24 characters this program creates a 3D view of a maze for you to navigate from a rats eye view. The listing here has been reformatted to make it slightly more readable. It uses a technique called ray casting which was employed by early 3D video games like Wolfenstein 3D and Doom to essentially extrude a 2D map and fake a 3D appearance.

In Codeblock Raycaster you must navigate a maze seeking for the fabled red block. When you find it a new red block will appear. Find 5 red blocks and you win the game. Use the arrow keys to move. Press the escape key to end your game early.

This program is an excellent starting point, but it could use a few things. You could easily improve the game with a randomly generated map. If you were a bit more adept you could figure out a way to change the goals from red squares to gems or treasure chests.

Codeblock Raycaster was written by Terry Cavanagh.
