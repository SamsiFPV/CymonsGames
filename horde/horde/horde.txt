THE STORY

"You play Chauncey, one of King Winthrop the Good's humble servants.
During a meal at which you are serving food, the king begins choking on
a bit of turkey.

The other people at the table are so engrossed in one of Kronus
Maelor("the Evil High Chancellor")'s stories, that they don't notice
the king's predicament. But you, realizing the magnitude of the
situation, perform a royal Heimlich maneuver on his highness, saving
his life.

Although Maelor wishes you imprisoned for attacking the king, King
Winthrop has a better grasp on the situation and rewards your valor by
knighting you "Sir Chauncey" and giving you a small tract of land known
as the Shimto Plains.

While vast tracts of land are nice, these particular tracts of land are
infested with "The Horde". Luckily, as part of your reward for saving
his life, the good king has given you his mighty hordling-crushing
sword, Grimthwacker with which to thwart the advance of the foul
beasts."
