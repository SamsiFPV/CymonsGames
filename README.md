CymonsGames
===========

All the programs from Cymon's Games, a repository of C/C++ programs inspired by Type-Ins of old. lots of great educational material.

Cymon's Games was a website that ran from February 16th, 2008 and ended on June 6th, 2014 when it's owner, Joe Larson, decided not to renew it's site license. Starting in 2008 it published a new program every week which eventually dropped off and stopped entirely on August 20th, 2010 with the last type-in, Caesar Cypher. The programs were submitted mostly by Joe Larson but included submissions by many others. Where possible credit is given in the listing.

About
The long term goal of Cymon’s Games is to provide a teaching resource (aka book) that teaches C/C++ programming through examples and tutorials. The short term goal is to provide a game a week with source code (that can eventually be included in the book.)

Cymon’s Games is inspired by the type-in programs of yester-year, when game listings were distributed in print on the pages of magazines. While at the time they were a method of distributing free games they had an effect that was far more reaching. Typing in these programs were a generation’s introduction to programming and inspired many who have gone on to professional produce games today.

Each week Cymon’s Games features a different program, usually small and simple but that are fun to play. You are encouraged to look at its source code by providing it along with the download and providing the source code formatted as you might find it in a book. As you look over the code you may find yourself wanting to write a few lines yourself or fiddle with someone else’s program. All you have to do is get yourself setup with a compiler and the necessary libraries and you’re ready to go.

So you want to make your own games? Great. But don’t think you can just jump in and make cool games like the ones you’d buy at the store. You’re going to need to start simple.

For beginners Cymon’s Games is a great place to start.

If you’re running windows, before can you start you’ll need to load a compiler and you’ll probably want to use a program to make programming easier called an IDE. There are many to choose from. Cymon’s Games recomends MinGW with Code::Blocks. Instructions on getting set up are here.

Your first program should be simple and it is recommended that you actually type it in, not just copy and paste the code. Fortunately hello is simple and small. Print it out, type it in, and you’re on your way. Next, stick with the simpler programs for a while.

As you’re skills improve you can return here to extend the functionality of your compiler with add on libraries like PDCurses or Allegro. Once you’ve added them then more programs become available to you.
