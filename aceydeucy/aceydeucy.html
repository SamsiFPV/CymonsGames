<img src="/pages/aceydeucy/aceydeucy.gif" alt="" align="right" />Acey Deucy is a simple card game. You are dealt 2 cards and have to decide if the next card will be between the two dealt. If you don’t think you have a chance the game deals you two more cards, no score for that round. But if you do think you have a chance a third card is delt. If your right you score 10 points, if you’re wrong you lose 25. If the two cards dealt are adjacent to each you automatically lose 25 points. When that happens a too-cautious player may find themselves having a hard time maintaining a positive score.
Acey Deucy is written by Joseph Larson inspired by a BASIC game by Bill Palmby as found in 'BASIC Computer Games' edited by David H. Ahl (c) 1978
