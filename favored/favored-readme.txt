The Favored, a 7DRL by Joe Larson (joealarson@gmail.com)

INTRODUCTION
The Favored is similar to another text based game, Robotfindskitten, in reverse. Instead of searching around trying to find something you are drawn to hunt, hoping you won't find something. With each successful kill the odds of picking a favored bunny get worse. Pay attention to the fraction between the bunnies on the left, that's the probability that you'll pick a favored, 1 out of how many rabbits there are. You can carry bunnies with you to the next level, but you may want to leave early to keep your chances from getting worse.

To keep the hunt fun you are encouraged with amusing little messages when you do a kill. Pay attention to them because they're half the fun.

STORY
You are a new adventurer who was leveling up in the fields around your starting village by killing rodents and other small animals when a rabbit you were chasing ran across a clearing, stopping only a few yards away. As you closed the distance to the creature the ground beneath you suddenly gave way and you found yourself falling into darkness. A trap? How could a rabbit set a trap?

Fortunately the rabbit’s plan seems to have been only half-baked for as soon as you awoke you found yourself in a huge rabbit down, but none of the other rabbits seem intent on harming you. You try to climb out, but the ceiling of the cave you’re in is too far away. Occasionally you see spots where you could get up if you had some rope or something.

Unknown to our adventurer this is the down of the favored wherein on each level lives a rabbit favored of the rabbit gods. Killing this hallowed creature will bring down the wrath of an angry deity.

Unaware of the danger you face you begin the process of leveling up and harvesting what you will need to get out.

PLAYING THE GAME
You control your character using the keypad or the following keys:

Q W E	Y K U	7 8 9
 \|/	 \|/	 \|/
A-@-D	H-@-L	4-@-8
 /|\	 /|\	 /|\
Z X C	B J N	1 2 3

ESC quits. Press any other key to wait where you are.

Move into a rabbit to attack them. You can only carry so many rabbits at a time. Move into the exit to drop the dead bunnies you’ve collected there. When you drop enough corpses on the exit it will change into a ‘<’. Then just walk into it to go to the next level, but keep in mind that when you go up a level you can’t go back.

ABOUT PROBABILITY AND ODDS
The number on the left between the bunnies is the probability in fractional notion of choosing a favored bunny. So if it’s 1/20 that means 1 bunny out of 20 will end your game. However, if you succeed by picking one of the other 19 the probability of picking a favored now changes to 1 in 19 for the next kill. Not a dramatic change, but not as much in your favor as the previous kill. 

But this is where the cumulative probability comes in.  You just survived a 1 out of 20 chance of dying, so your next chance of surviving exists within the 19 out of 20 that remains. So the next your probably of surviving is 18 out of 19, but taken with the previous probability it’s actually (19/20) * (18/19), the product of the two probabilities of survival.

Another way to think about this is a pie chart. Imagine a pie chart where 1/20th of it has been cut out as “chances to die.” Then on your next draw marks 1/19th of the remaining, not 1/19th of the whole but just 1/19th of what’s left after you remove the 1/20th. The next time you remove 1/18th of the remainder, and then 1/17th of what’s left after that and so on. Hopefully you can visualize how quickly your chances of survival are being whittled away. 

While the individual encounters aren’t getting much worse from time to time, taken all together it’s a miracle when you make it to the end. That’s where the commutative probability at the end comes from.

THANKS
Special thanks to http://www.rootsecure.net/index.php?p=ascii_generator so I didn't have to do all the ASCII lettering myself and to http://www.chris.com/ASCII/ for the bunnies in the side bar.
Special Thanks to everyone on irc://irc.quakenet.org/#rgrd who helped me write the first draft of kill messages.

KILL MESSAGES
